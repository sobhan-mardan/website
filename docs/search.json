Through this work, I have gained exposure to diverse clinical conditions, research methodologies, and healthcare practices, and have developed a strong appreciation for how research translates into real-world patient care.\nWhat I find most rewarding is working collaboratively with multidisciplinary teams to bring ideas together and contribute to evidence-based care that can make a meaningful difference for patients.\nBelow is a summary of my experience, skills, and recognitions so far, which I look forward to continuing to build as my training and career progress."

Using causal inference methods applied to observational data, I examine whether patients’ frailty status modifies the effectiveness of OAC, with a focus on clinically important outcomes such as stroke and mortality."
